### Postman API Demo tests
This is an example of the API tests that can be created using Postman.
These tests introduce the way of using pre- and post- request scripting by using Javascript.
The exported JSON file (tests) can be easily imported to any Postman client for further improvements or run directly by using Postman CLI extention.
Tests also can be run as a Data Driven stack by using Postman Runner. In such case a small modification will be needed (add variables and adjust the payloads or path segments) and .CSV file required.
